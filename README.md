# bfernando.github.io
This is my first file change

1. Brandon Fernando/bfernando@my.waketech.edu
2. My Github account is an open source where I can create repositories for work with flexibility and scalability.
4. The repository I created was a clone from the original name bfernando.github.io. After I cloned the repository I was able to go in the folder and edit it giving me the option to commit changes and push the changed to GitHub Desktop.
